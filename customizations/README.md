# Graph Matrix 3D Customizations
This directory will hold customised classes inheriting from the Graph_Matrix classes.

### Customizations, MemoryPools and ThreadPools
Say for example, an extended matrix that provides better efficiency for sparse matrices, but still can develop above this implementation, or implementation that utilise custom MemoryPool or ThreadPool implementations, these are under development only, but its development will significantly slow down, since i move to my WorldLine Simulator again, but neverthless i would keep making it more customizable.
