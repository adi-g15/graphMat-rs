# GraphMat - Rust FFI/Port

IN DEVELOPMENT... Currently take a look at https://github.com/adi-g15/graphMat, if the idea seems interesting, that one's already complete.

> Header-only Library
>
> Matrix implemented as a graph, specially for the use case when it should be auto expanding at custom rate, specially in simulations.
> A matrix header-only library, uses graphs internally, helpful when your matrix is part of a simulation where it needs to grow many times (or just automatically keep growing).
